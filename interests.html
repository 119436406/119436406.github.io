			<h2>Sports:</h2>
			
			<p>From a very young age i had a great love for Irish Culture and history but most importantly a passion for Irish Dancing. At the age of 5 I began dancing in my local dance school. I quickly learned that i was quite talented when it came to this sport. This sport ran in my family for decades as many family members throughout the years participarted in the sport. I also did competitions in which I was very successful. There are 5 stages in the dancing competitions in which you progress depending on how well you do in them. The first level is bungrade followed by,prelim,advanced,championship and international level. I managed to progress to the international level where I competed in competitions in England,Canada and the United States of America. There are different types of Irish Dancing which are Ceili,Irish stepdance,Sean-nos and Irish set dance. People who compete in competitions must wear elaborate dresses to catch the judges eye when they're dancing. These dresses cant cost up to £1000. It is an extremly competitive sport which is revolved around looks and not so much about how talented you really are,however I extremely enjoyed participating in this sport.  </p>
		
		<h3> History Of Irish Dancing:</h3>
		
		<p>The roots of Irish dancing come from the Celts and the druids who roamed the island before the onset of Christianity and outside influences came along. Many of the druid's religious rituals invloved dancing,usually in a circular fashion around sacred trees. The Celts had their own fold fances wiht similar formations. This type of dancing was common around much of the European mainland at the time, and although it wasn't really anything like what traditional Irish dancing became, remnants of the formations and patterns can be seen.</p>
	<p> Naturally, the dancing was accompanied by music or singing and usually took place at religious celebrations or other special occasions. The feis was a big local celebration held by Celtic communities. It was all about their art, culture and music as well as an opportunity for disucssing politics, trading, playing sports and storytelling. Dancing was an integral part of the feis. At the Hill of Tara, then the seat of the High King of Ireland and the eoicentre of Celtic life, a huge feis known as the 'Aonach' was held once a year, apparently beginning over a thousand years ago. Feiseanna are still held today in many communities,but these days they are usually just a showcase for Irish Dancing and Music, where dancers compete for medals and trophies.
	<p>Today, the costume of Irish dancing is recognised all over the world. Whilst all having similar qualities, each costume is different depending on where it is coming from. The dresses made today are inspired by those worn by peasants over 200 years ago.The dresses worn by women feature beautiful embroidered detailing, and a copy of the Tara brooch worn on the shoulder holding a cape which falls over the back. The outfit worn by men for Irish dancing is a kilt and jacket, with a cloak draped from the shoulder. Both men and women wear hornpipe shoes, or soft shoes depending on the type of dance.Today in Ireland there are céili’s held all over the country celebrating the traditional Irish dance, music, and storytelling. The huge success of Riverdance and Lord of the Dance has placed the traditional dances on international stages, encouraging people to partake in the dance and keep the tradition alive. </p>
	



   <h4> Travel:</h4>
   <p> Travel has always been a huge interest of mine. I remember the first time I ever got on a plane I was 6 years old and we went to Germany.I loved the feeling you got in your stomach as the plane took off into the sky. I have travelled to many places throughout my life such as Spain,England,Portugal,France,Italy and Poland.The place which I enjoy visiting the most is Torremolinos in Malaga in Spain. I have gone here for the past 10 years with my family. It is a city with an amazing beach front. There are many amazing things to do here from sitting by the pool to going jet skiing and even hiking. My family and I love to go here every summer. We have stayed in many different hotels here but our faveourite has been Sol Don Pedro. There is amazing facilities here and it is right on the beachfront!</p>
