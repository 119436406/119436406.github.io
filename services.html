	<h2>Hyperautomation:</h2>
	
	<p>As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” Hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. Hyperautomation is different from regular automation. Hyperautomation takes advanced tools and combines them to make to create a new way to work. Hyperautomation highly benefits your business. It provides your business and its leaders with: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Automated Processes</li>
  <li>Advanced Analytics</li>
  <li>Increased employee satisfaction and motivation</li>
  <li>An educated workforce </li>
  <li>Increased employee capacity</li>
  <li>Instant and accurate insights</li>
  <li>Greater compliance and reduced risk</li>
  <li>Greater productivity</li>
  <li>Increased team collaboration</li>
  </ul>

	 <ul>
	 <li>All the different ways users interact with a brand</li>
	 <li>The multitude of physical devices delivering the user experiences resulting from those interactions</li>

		<h4>Distributed Cloud:</h4>
		<p>A distributed file system for a cloud is a file system that allows many clients to have access to data and supports operations on that data. Each data file may be partitioned into several parts called chunks. Each chunk may be stored on different remote machines, facilitating the parallel execution of applications.
		A distributed cloud refers to having computation,storage and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and opportunities for increased security. Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. A distributed cloud also processes da5a in real-time.</p>
